This project explores the task of flower classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify five different flowers which are daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip. For the training, a publicly available Kaggle dataset is used. During this project two approaches are investigated: a custom Convolutional Neural Network, which was designed and trained from scratch, and a transfer learning method using EfficientNetB1 as a base model. The custom CNN provided a foundational understanding of model training but could only reach an accuracy of 79%. In contrast, the transfer learning approach significantly improved performance, achieving a test accuracy of 92.076% and strong precision, recall and F1-scores across all flower classes. Training and evaluation were conducted using TensorFlow, Keras, and Weights and Biases for experiment tracking. 
The results show the effectiveness of transfer learning in small image classification tasks and support its application in real-world flower identification systems. Future work might include expanding the flower range, fine-tuning the model, and integrating it in a practical application.
